# push_swap
Push Swap. 42 proyect 

In this proyect you have to order a stack of numbers. 

The compiclacion is only have other stack to move the numbers, only can use some movemenst and you have a limitation of number of movements.

In this versi√≥n I found a solution verry efficient. It do under 5000 moves to 500 elements.
